# Scamazon (Parody site)

This is a tiny Flask-based parody marketplace with intentionally silly "scam" products for comedy and education. It is explicitly a parody — do not use this to defraud or mislead anyone.

How to run:

1. Create a virtual environment and install dependencies:

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Run the app:

```bash
python app.py
```

Then open http://127.0.0.1:5000 in your browser.
